The first part of assignment 4 encompasses recreating multiple shapes with varying scale, location, color, etc... with a single loop. There's a decent chance I 
did this wrong now that I think about it. I don't think I actually looped it but rather just invoked a function over and over again. I will ask about it after
class. The sketch makes stars with varying points, size, and location as well as color. It's mostly experimental in composition to try different elements. (I AM GOING TO CLEAN THIS UP AS WELL)

Part 2 takes my star function and adds it three separate times into an array of three separate sprites. The array is then read by a conditional function to
create a row effect of the stars with different colors, sizes, and points. It is mostly finished though I want to clean it up.
