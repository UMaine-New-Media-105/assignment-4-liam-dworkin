The first part of assignment 4 encompasses recreating multiple shapes with varying scale, location, color, etc... with a single loop. There's a decent chance I 
did this wrong now that I think about it. I don't think I actually looped it but rather just invoked a function over and over again. I will ask about it after
class. The sketch makes stars with varying points, size, and location as well as color. It's mostly experimental in composition to try different elements.
